      <h1>Selected Projects by Glenn Kouhia</h1> 
      <p id="para1">Below you'll find a list of projects that Glenn has worked on recently. </p>
      <p>The projects are listed in the order in which they were created. As you might expect, the early projects demonstrate basic knowledge of a topic and make use of simple, mainstream HTML elements and CSS styles. And, more recent projects are just a little more advanced.</p>
      <p> Click a link to view one. Remember, please, even now each project remains merely a work in progress!</p>
