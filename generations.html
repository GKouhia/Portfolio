        <h3>My Pride</h3>
        <p>I am lucky to be part of a big, multi-generational family. Doubly lucky because we get along remarkably well. At times it feels like being part of a lion's pride. </p>

        <h3>Molecular Family</h3>
        <p>Collectively, the people in my family, past and present, make me who I am today.</p>
        <p>I am a husband and father of two kids. My wife is a native Washingtonian and my best friend in life.

        <h3>Next Generation</h3>        
        <p>My wife and kids inspire me everyday with their kindness and their brilliance. Our kids are ages 17 and 12, and they're fun, happy, smart and, for the most part, reasonably well-adjusted young people.</p>

        <p>If brilliance skips a generation then it was mine that was skipped. Just ask Dartmouth College.</p>
